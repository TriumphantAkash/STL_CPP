--> Associative containers are typically implemented with binary tree
--> The Key attribute of associative containers is that they are always sorted
    So, when you insert an element, it gets inserted at right position
    and when you delete an element from them, it makes sure it is sorted after delete oprtn

--> push_back(), push_front() does not make sense then.

--> The world 'associative' in the associative containers comes from the MAPS, where key is associated with a value
